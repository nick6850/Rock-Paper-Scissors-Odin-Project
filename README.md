# Rock Paper Scissors Odin Project
 Simple rock paper scissors game implemented in JavaScript. The game runs in the browser console - the computer randomly selects rock, paper or scissors and the user makes a selection by entering a number (1=rock, 2=paper, 3=scissors). The selections are compared and a winner is displayed.
 
 This project is part of a coding basics course to learn JavaScript fundamentals. It will serve as a starting point to build out more interactive game experiences using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Contributions and feedback welcome!
